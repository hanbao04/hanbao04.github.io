I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D studies within the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Departement of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), under the guidance of [Prof. Bruno da Silva](https://www.etrovub.be/people/member/about-bio/bdasilva/). My research topic is FPGA-based applied edge AI.

I obtained my BSc in Microelectronics degree from [Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU)](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn) in 2022. In 2021, I participated in a bachelor-master joint program between NPU and [Brussels Faculty of Engineering (Bruface)](https://www.bruface.eu), completing my MSc in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Nano-electronics and Circuit Design in 2023.
