I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D studies within the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Departement of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO), under the guidance of .[Prof. Bruno da Silva](https://www.etrovub.be/people/member/about-bio/bdasilva/). My research topic is FPGA-based applied edge AI.

I obtained my MSc in EE from .[Bruface](https://www.bruface.eu) in 2023 and my BSc in Microelectronics degree from .[Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn) in 2022.
