Master thesis for MSc degree in Bruface
* Implement different memory polynomial models as digital pre-distorters(DPD) and compare the performance in MATLAB.
* Using 4G, 5G and WiFi signal as excitation to test the performance of DPD on a commercial power amplifier(PA).
* Using own-designed 1.6GHz PA to test the performance of DPD.
